# Magic String Vanisher

This is a simple Python program that allows users to manipulate a string by making certain characters disappear. It employs basic string manipulation methods to perform the operation.

## How it works

1. The user is asked to input a string (sentence) that they would like to experiment on.
2. The program will then prompt the user to input characters they would like to make disappear from the string.
3. The user can input as many characters as they want. Once they have finished inputting characters, they should type 'READY'.
4. The program then creates a new string by removing the specified characters from the original string.
5. The final result is then printed to the console.

## Features

The program uses special ANSI escape codes to enhance the console output. These codes are used to color and style the text. The program uses bold, underline, and red color to highlight important parts of the output.

## Requirements

This program does not have any special requirements. It is built using standard Python libraries. Therefore, any standard Python3 interpreter should be able to run this program.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the Python file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
4. Run the following command to execute the program:
```
python filename.py
```
Remember to replace "filename.py" with the actual filename of the Python script.
